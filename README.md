# Challenging the availability heuristic with data visualisations: PSY6422 Data Project

Repository for my data project, completed as part of my MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science at the University of Sheffield.
The project uses a dataset obtained from Kaggle.com, which details shark attacks from around the world since ??  

The project aims to assess the extent to which estimations of shark attacks are affected by the availability heuristic, by visualising this data for readers to gauge how accurate their perceptions are.  

This project was coded in R, and a dependency manager (Renv) was used to manage packages.
