# PSY6422: Data Management and Visualisation Project

## Challenging the availability heuristic with data visualisations

This is the repository for my PSY6422 data project, completed as part of my MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science at the University of Sheffield.

The project uses a dataset obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/ncsaayali/shark-attack-dataset), which details shark attacks around the world over the past 100+ years (this projects uses data from a 50 year span of 1969-2019).

The project aims to assess the extent to which estimations of shark attacks are affected by the availability heuristic, by visualising this data for readers to gauge how accurate their perceptions are. Two visualisations are presented, each accompanied by the code written to prepare the data and produce the graphs.

This project was coded in R, and a dependency manager (Renv) was used to manage packages.

Files included in this repository are as follows:
*shark_data.xls* - raw data in Excel format  
*codebook.rtf* - coodebook detailing variables in the raw data set  
*stylesheet.css* - CSS style sheet used to add formatting to the R Markdown file  
*never_swim_again.jpeg* - image used in the R Markdown file  
*README.md* - the current README file  
*index.Rmd* - R Markdown file  
*index.html* - HTML version of my R Markdown page  
*renv.lock* - dependency manager file which captures packages, R and their versions used in the project
