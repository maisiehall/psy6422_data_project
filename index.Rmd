### Project Motivation
At the time of creating this project (April 2021), 11 of the 20 results which appear on the first page of the [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news) website when searching ‘shark attacks’ mention Australia in the headline or caption. Such information is likely to inform estimations of how often shark attacks occur in Australia. **Thus, the aim of this project is to use data visualisations to assess whether the availability heuristic influences estimations of how frequently shark attacks occur in Australia.**  

*What is the availability heuristic?*  
In cognitive psychology, the availability heuristic refers to a cognitive bias which is frequently used when estimating the likelihood of an event. The easier an example of an event comes to mind, the more common the event is deemed to be.

The availability heuristic was first discussed by [Kahneman and Tversky (1973)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010028573900339), and was chosen to be the main focus of this project for two main reasons:  
1. Anybody is prone to cognitive biases and everyone is likely to have been influenced by the availability heuristic at some point.  
2. Visualisations can be useful for challenging judgments and perceptions when people are otherwise unlikely to question themselves.

### Research Questions  
- How often do shark attacks happen in Australia? Do they happen more or less often than in other countries?  
- How does the frequency of shark attacks compare to the reader’s estimate of how often they happen? Are estimations accurate or are they potentially influenced by the availability heuristic?  

Before continuing, ask yourself… how many shark attacks do you think have happened in Australia over the past 50 years? Note that here, *Australia* refers to any mainland state or territory.

### Data
A data set has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) which includes 16 different variables related to shark attacks around the world, and this data set can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ncsaayali/shark-attack-dataset). The first 5 rows of the data are shown below:

```{r, create table, include=FALSE}
#Read in the raw data set
raw_data <- readxl::read_xls(here("data", "shark_data.xls"))

#Delete variables which aren't needed
shark_data <- raw_data %>%
  select(Year, Country, Area, `Fatal (Y/N)`)

#Rename variables to get rid of capital letters (for ease when coding)
shark_data <- shark_data %>%
  rename(year = Year, country = Country, area = Area, fatal = `Fatal (Y/N)`)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Display first five rows of data set
knitr::kable(shark_data[1:5, ],)
```
### Visualisation 1 (interactive): Top three countries over 50 years
The following code will demonstrate the data wrangling that was performed in order to prepare the data for visualisation 1.

```{r, variable prep}
#See which countries have the most shark attacks
count(shark_data, country, sort=TRUE)

#Limit data to the top three countries
shark_data <- shark_data[(shark_data$country=="AUSTRALIA" |
                            shark_data$country=="USA" |
                            shark_data$country =="SOUTH AFRICA"), ]

#Specify time span to be plotted
shark_data <- subset(shark_data, year > "1968" & year < "2020")
```

```{r, missing data, include=FALSE}
#Check for missing data in variables relevant to current graph i.e. country, year
colSums(is.na(shark_data))
```

```{r, line graph}
#Data to plot
country_per_year <- shark_data %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% count(year)

#Line graph
line_plot <- ggplot(data = country_per_year,
  aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = n, group = 1, color = country,
      text = paste(
        "Year:", as.numeric(year),
         "<br>Number of shark attacks:", n,
           "<br>Country:", country),
           )
       ) +
  geom_line() +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("navy", "burlywood1", "sienna2")) +
      theme_light() +
        ggtitle(
          "Number of shark attacks between 1969-2019 in the three most affected countries") +
   xlab("Year") + 
    ylab("Number of shark attacks") +
      theme(text=element_text(family="Georgia")) +
        scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950,2020,10))

#Make plot interactive
ggplotly(line_plot, tooltip = "text") %>% 
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", x = 0.225, y = -0.2)) 
```

**If you were surprised by these results, your estimation may have been influenced by the availability heuristic.**

### Visualisation 2: Fatalities
Now that we have looked at the overall trend of shark attacks in Australia and how it compares to other countries, we can look at how many of the attacks resulted in a fatal accident. To do this, we will focus on the year 2018 (as this was the year that the most attacks happened in Australia) and look at how many attacks in each area resulted in a fatality.

What proportion of shark attacks do you think are deadly?

```{r, data wrangling, warning = FALSE}
#First, address the NA data
colSums(is.na(shark_data))

#Reassign the NA values to missing so that we can test for them
shark_data$area[is.na(shark_data$area)] <- "Missing"

#Check whether there are any missing data in the 'area' column which are related to Australia
sum(shark_data$country == "AUSTRALIA" & shark_data$area == "Missing")

#Subset Australian data only
aus <- 
	shark_data[shark_data$country == "AUSTRALIA", ]

#Keep mainland areas and territories only
aus_states <- aus[!(aus$area=="Tasmania" | aus$area=="Torres Strait" | aus$area=="Norfolk Island" | aus$area=="Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands"),]

#Check that the remaining data is correct
count(aus_states, area, sort = TRUE)
#Rename data entries which have a typo (##7)
aus_states$area[aus_states$area=="Westerm Australia"] <- "Western Australia"
```

```{r, dealing with missing data, warning=FALSE}
#Delete excess empty rows of data
aus_states <- aus_states[-c(1300:20608), ] 
#Check how many NA's remain
colSums(is.na(aus_states))
#Change all NA's in 'fatal' variable to 'unknown' so that they can be grouped and plotted
aus_states$fatal[is.na(aus_states$fatal)] <- "Unknown"

#Re-code data entries in 'fatal' variable so that they show up as desired in the legend
aus_states$fatal[aus_states$fatal == "UNKNOWN"] <- "Unknown"
aus_states$fatal[aus_states$fatal == "Y"] <- "Yes"
aus_states$fatal[aus_states$fatal == "N"] <- "No"
```

```{r, histogram, warning=FALSE}
#Reorder x-axis categories so that 'unknown' is at the end. Then, plot the graph
plot <- aus_states %>%
  mutate(area = fct_relevel(area,
                            "New South Wales", "Northern Territory", "Queensland", "South Australia", "Victoria", "Western Australia", "Area unknown")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = area, y = ..count.., fill = fatal)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
      xlab("Year") +
       ylab("Number of shark attacks") +
         ggtitle("Number of fatal shark attacks throughout Australia in 2018") +
           scale_fill_manual(name = "Fatal", 
                             values = c("lightseagreen", "pink", "brown2")) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,200,20)) +
     theme_light()

#Create x-axis labels with line breaks and to match order of histogram bars
labs = c("New South\n Wales", "Northern\nTerritory", "Queensland", "South\nAustralia", "Victoria", "Western\nAustralia", "Area\nunknown")

#More plot aesthetics
plot + scale_x_discrete(labels=labs) +
  theme(text = element_text(family="Georgia")) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))
```

### Summary and future directions
This project aimed to demonstrate how the availability heuristic influences judgments regarding the frequency of shark attacks in Australia. The visualisations show that the most attacks in a 12-month period was in 2018, when 39 attacks occurred (although only a small proportion of the attacks were fatal). However, the USA consistently experiences more shark attacks than Australia.

Although these visualisations enable the reader to get an idea of the number of attacks which take place, no data was available regarding how many attacks people *estimate* to happen. This meant that, in order to assess the affect of the availability heuristic on judgments, I had to rely on asking the reader to make a mental estimate in order for them to assess how accurate their estimation was. To improve this project, data should be collected regarding estimations so that a visualisation can be plotted to provide a direct comparison of how accurate judgments are... If people estimate too high a number, it would suggest that the availability heuristic is at play!
